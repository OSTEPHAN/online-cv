        Breton d'origine, j'ai découvert la région Auvergne et suivi le cursus informatique

        et que j'accompagne avec une approche moderne du management. 
        Humour, bienveillance et curiosite restent trois mots que je partage dans cette 
        philosophie pour nourrir et faire grandir le collectif.

    - role: Sofware Development Team Leader 
      time: 2016 - Present
      company: Orange, Mougins
      details: |
        I am a technical leader involved in key strategic products 
        that leverage skills and new ways of working within a team focused on data and AI. 
        My main responsabilities are about designing a configurable voice assistant for different business units, 
        consolidating tools for research upon edge AI, 
        and also building features to automate data treatment during continuous delivery of projects. 
        All of these projects are hosted on a private and internal cloud platform, 
        but hybrid architecture is a target we are looking for with help of different identified providers. 
        I am truly involved by the way with other companies in Sophia Antipolis to share open knowledge on these topics 
        within an industrial consortium that aims to start cross-innovation. 
        I prepare and present regular technical reviews to directors and even at group CEO level. 
        My role in project is to lead and enhance a digital transformation transversal to the Group 
        while propagating software culture and coding main components that 
        will be baseline in present or future deliveries. 
        I lead a team of dozen people dispatched in several projects 
        that combine several forces from researchers, designers, developpers 
        but also operationals. 
        SAFe is a standard that we assume, 
        but I often use to say that agility may be resumed in only three words 
        adaptability, communication and collaboration.

        These APIs were consumed by thousands of mobile to 
        validate digital tickets and to ensure they were authorized for an event.

        One feature I had to develop was to ensure data redundancy 
        with help of archive logs in Oracle. 
        Robots protocol and runtime constraints were also a true challenge 
        I had to succeed, especially for maintenance 
        with very short timeframe not to disrupt human chain production.
